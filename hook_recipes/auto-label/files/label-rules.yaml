# Label Rules Configuration
# Define patterns that automatically apply labels to tickets
#
# Each rule has:
#   - label: the label to apply
#   - patterns: list of substrings to match (case-insensitive)
#
# If any pattern matches the ticket content (title or body),
# the label is added to the ticket's labels field.
